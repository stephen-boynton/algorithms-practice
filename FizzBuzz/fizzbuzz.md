# FizzBuzz

The modelo is important in this one. `num % 3 === 0` etc...
The most important thing to remember is to use your if statement correctly. The most complex if statement should be first. If it requires an `&&` operator, it should be at the top.

## Pro Tips

Use `if(i % 15 === 0)` as your first statement, because if you're checking for divisibility by 3 and 5, it's the same as being divisible by 15.
